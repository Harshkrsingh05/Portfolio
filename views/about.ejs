        <ul><li>Playing Games</li>
            <li>Watching movies</li> 
            <li>Travelling</li>
        </ul></p>
        <p class="card-text">You can also call me a designer, developer,UI, UX or by any other market defined function-title. I'm also a multi-disciplinary maker with over 1 years of experiences in wide range of design disciplines, manager, advisor, front-end developer, music enthusiast, traveler, and more.</p>
        <p class="card-text">I don't like to define myself by the work I've done. I define myself by the work I want to do. Skills can be taught, personality is inherent. I prefer to keep learning, continue challenging myself, and do interesting things that matter.</p>
        <p class="card-text">Fueled by high energy levels and boundless enthusiasm. I'm passionate, expressive, multi-talented spirit with a natural ability to entertain and inspire. I'm never satisfied to just come up with ideas. Instead I have an almost impulsive need to act on them.</p>
